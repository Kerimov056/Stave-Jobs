        <p class="info">Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 
        1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop 
        and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. 
        It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc.</p>
        <div id="main">
            <p class="nex"> By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power 
                struggles between executives, caused problems.
                Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued
                other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and 
                founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.</p>

            As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved 
            throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share 
            to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows 
            operating system on Intel-powered PC clones 
            (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy,
            the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful 
            operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company.
